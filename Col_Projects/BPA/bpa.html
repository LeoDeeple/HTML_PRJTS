<pre class="prebpa">
Business process automation (BPA) is the use of advanced technology to complete business processes with minimal human intervention. 
A business process is an activity, or a set of activities, used to accomplish a specific organizational goal, such as producing a 
product, assimilating new employees or bringing on new customers

<!--<div class="linkwithben">-->
<ul>
<li>increased productivity</li>
<li>reduced error rates</li>
<li>greater employee satisfaction</li>

<pre class="def">
Taking humans out of repetitive tasks that are better handled by machines saves time and reduces error 
rates, provided that the steps in the process are well defined, subject to limited interpretation and that 
exceptions -- instances where human intervention is required -- are communicated to the right people by the 
process automation system for timely resolution. Workflow automation of menial tasks also frees up employees 
to focus on higher value work.

What are the advantages of BPA in CSE?
</pre>
<pre>
1. Time savings
	
Business process automation saves your employees a great deal of time and allows them to work smarter, not harder.
By charging machines with completing recurrent, rule-based tasks, employees can free up time to focus on work that 
requires critical thinking, creativity, or the human touch.
<hr>
2. Greater efficiency

Business process automation helps companies fulfil tedious tasks with minimal resources. Companies get faster and more 
reliable results with lower costs, thus improving efficiency significantly.
<hr>
3. Error minimization
Even the most capable and skilled employees make mistakes. Lack of attention, absent-mindedness, forgetfulness, and multitasking 
can all hinder the performance of your employees — especially when performing routine tasks.

Unlike humans, computers don’t forget. Plus, they never get tired or distracted. Therefore, automating processes helps companies 
decrease the likelihood of human error dramatically.
<hr>
4. Better standardization
Different employees often perform the same processes in different ways. But unfortunately, these ways are not always the most efficient.
On the other hand, automation solutions always follow the same steps to complete tasks and never stray from the rules you define. Hence,
 business process automation can help you standardize processes, achieve consistent results, and increase transparency across the organisation.
<hr>
5. Superior customer experience
Convenience and fast access to products and services matter most to today’s customers.
Business process automation enables faster response times, data-driven personalization, and consistency across 
different channels. This improves the customer experience and helps companies differentiate themselves from the competition.
